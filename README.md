## Project Structure

The project consists of the following structure:

```
chatbot-project/
├── build/                # Contains build files for packaging the chatbot (e.g., `chatbot.spec`)
├── data/                 # Data files required by the chatbot (e.g., training data, model files)
├── dist/                 # Distribution folder (contains packaged chatbot files for deployment)
├── LICENSE               # License information for the project
├── chatbot.py            # Main script for the chatbot logic
├── chatbot.spec          # Specification file for packaging the chatbot (if using PyInstaller or similar)
├── pyvenv.cfg            # Configuration file for the virtual environment
└── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies for the project
```

- `chatbot.py`: The main Python script where the chatbot's logic resides.
- `build/`: Contains any build files needed to package the chatbot application.
- `data/`: Stores any data files that the chatbot uses, such as models or training data.
- `dist/`: The folder that holds the final distributable files after packaging.
- `chatbot.spec`: A specification file used for packaging the chatbot, possibly with tools like PyInstaller.
- `requirements.txt`: The file that lists all the dependencies required to run the project.
